# Learning to swim via one-step Q-learning

This is an implementation of the one-step Q-learning method for a simple two-link microswimmer.
It is part of the course PHYS 350 Applications of Classical Mechanics, winter 2022, UBC.

To run the code, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project `git clone ...`
2. Go to the folder and run the python script `python main.py`
3. The results are saved as pdf in the main folder. The snapshots are in the `pics/` folder.

There are mainly three model parameters, which you can modify. See `main.py` for details.

*Good luck!*
